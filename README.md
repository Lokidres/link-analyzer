# Advanced Link Analyzer

## Overview

The **Advanced Link Analyzer** is a Python-based tool designed to analyze web pages comprehensively. It extracts and evaluates various elements such as links, images, files, SSL certificates, domain information, and more. The tool also performs sentiment analysis on the text content to provide insights into the webpage's tone.

This project is ideal for developers, researchers, and SEO analysts who need to gather insights about a webpage's structure, content, and security.

- **Text Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzes the sentiment of the webpage's text content using NLTK's VADER sentiment analyzer.
- **Link Analysis**: Extracts and lists all hyperlinks on the webpage.
- **File Detection**: Identifies downloadable files (e.g., PDFs, Word documents, Excel files) linked on the webpage.
- **Broken Link Checker**: Detects and lists broken links on the webpage.
- **Results Export**: Saves the analysis results to a JSON file for further use.
